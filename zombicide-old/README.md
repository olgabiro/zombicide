# zombicide
This is an online scenario editor for [Zombicide](https://zombicide.com/en/).

It's written in jQuery, without any additional frameworks. 

As for now, the supported game editions are: Zombicide, Prison Outbreak and Rue Morgue.

Since there's no backend, you can print or download your scenario, but it won't be saved anywhere. 

## How to use editor
On the left panel you can choose which edition you want to use; many editions may be used at the same time.
On the top of the page you can find tiles that you can drag and drop on the canvas area. You can always change your mind by dragging
the tiles back to the tile panel.

If you want to place additional elements (e.g. doors), choose the right category from the menu on the left and drag the chosen item
on your board.

After creating you board, you can shrink it by pressing the button on the left (or just scroll down to the text form). 
Fill the fields for the title, difficulty, number of players, backstory and objectives. When you're done, click on the button
in the top left corner to print or download the created scenario.
